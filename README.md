# blood.pressure.logger
A React Native (Expo) application for logging your blood pressure

I'm exploring how far can I go implementing such a logger without ejecting from expo.

I am trying to also OCR the readings from the pressure measurer screen, so the user won't have to enter the measurements themselves.
(In order to not eject, I'm using a WebView, with tesseract, which for now doesn't work well).

# Prerequisites
You have to have `npm` and `expo-cli`. In my examplese, I'm using `yarn` to start and install, but it's probably okay to just use `npm` instead.


# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ninio/blood.pressure.logger
cd blood.pressure.logger
yarn
```


# Starting the app 
```
yarn start
```
