# blood.pressure.logger
A React Native (Expo) application for logging your blood pressure

Exploring how far can this be implemented without ejecting from expo.

# Prerequisites
You have to have `npm` and `expo-cli`. In my examplese, I'm using `yarn` to start and install, but it's probably okay to just use `npm` instead.


# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ninio/blood.pressure.logger
cd blood.pressure.logger
yarn
```


# Starting the app 
```
yarn start
```
